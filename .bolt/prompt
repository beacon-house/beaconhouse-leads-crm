#database-action-guidelines
you have to remember this golden rule always - form_sessions table must NOT be edited, updated, or any changes to be done, as they hold the leads from a different landing page. 

the only tables you can edit, update, or do any actions are the crm-tables. 
#design-guidelines
For all designs I ask you to make, have them be beautiful, not cookie cutter. Make webpages that are fully featured and worthy for production.

By default, this template supports JSX syntax with Tailwind CSS classes, React hooks, and Lucide React for icons. Do not install other packages for UI themes, icons, etc unless absolutely necessary or I request them.

Use icons from lucide-react for logos.
